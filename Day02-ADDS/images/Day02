# Day 2 â€“ Install AD DS and Create Domain

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Install and configure Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) on DC01 and create a new forest `lab.local`.

## ðŸ›  Steps Completed
1. Installed Windows Server 2022 Standard (Desktop Experience) on DC01.  
   - **Why:** Provides GUI and role support for easier lab management.  
2. Assigned static IP `192.168.1.10`.  
   - **Why:** Domain controllers require fixed IPs for reliability.  
3. Renamed server to `DC01`.  
   - **Why:** Clear naming convention for easier management.  
4. Installed AD DS role in Server Manager.  
   - **Why:** Enables Active Directory services.  
5. Promoted server to domain controller with new forest `lab.local`.  
   - **Why:** Created the labâ€™s root domain and forest.  
6. Verified ADUC shows `lab.local` and default containers.  
   - **Why:** Confirms AD DS is operational.  
7. Checked DNS SRV records in `_msdcs.lab.local`.  
   - **Why:** Ensures AD-integrated DNS is working for domain logons.

## ðŸ§  Reflection
- Learned the core process of standing up AD DS.  
- DNS integration is critical â€” without it, domain services fail.  
- Tomorrow: Configure DNS zones and test name resolution.
