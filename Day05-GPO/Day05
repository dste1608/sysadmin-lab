# Day 6 â€“ Group Policy Basics (Desktop Wallpaper)

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Create and apply a Group Policy Object (GPO) to enforce a desktop wallpaper on CLIENT01, demonstrating centralized management from DC01.

---

## ðŸ›  Steps Completed

1. **Created Shared Folder on DC01**
   - Folder: `C:\WallpaperShare`
   - File: `img7.jpg`
   - Shared as `\\DC01\Wallpapers`
   - Permissions: Read access for `Domain Users`
   - **Why:** Central repository so all clients can access the wallpaper.

2. **Created and Linked a GPO**
   - Name: `Lab Desktop Policy`
   - Linked at: `lab.local` domain root
   - **Why:** Ensures policy applies to all users in the domain.

3. **Configured GPO Settings**
   - Path: `User Configuration â†’ Policies â†’ Administrative Templates â†’ Desktop â†’ Desktop â†’ Desktop Wallpaper`
   - Wallpaper path: `\\DC01\Wallpapers\img7.jpg`
   - Style: Fill
   - **Why:** Centralized enforcement of desktop appearance.

4. **Applied Policy to CLIENT01**
   - Ran `gpupdate /force` on CLIENT01
   - Logged off and back on
   - Wallpaper updated successfully
   - **Why:** Verified GPO applied to a domain-joined client.

5. **Verified GPO Application**
   - Ran `gpresult /r` on CLIENT01
   - Confirmed `Lab Desktop Policy` applied
   - **Why:** Confirms GPO delivery and application.

## ðŸ§  Reflection
- Learned how to use Group Policy Management to control client desktops.
- Discovered that black screens result from unreachable wallpaper paths; fixed by hosting the wallpaper on a shared folder with proper permissions.
- Validated centralized management by forcing CLIENT01 to use a specific wallpaper from DC01.
- Takeaway: **For GPOs that depend on files, always use UNC paths (`\\server\share`) and confirm permissions.**
