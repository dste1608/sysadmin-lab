# Day 6 â€“ Password Policies via Group Policy

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Configure and enforce domain-wide password complexity, length, and expiration rules using Group Policy.

---

## ðŸ›  Steps Completed

1. **Opened Group Policy Management on DC01**
   - Navigated: `Forest: lab.local â†’ Domains â†’ lab.local`.
   - Edited the **Default Domain Policy**.
   - **Why:** Password settings must be applied at the domain root for them to affect all users.

2. **Configured Password Policies**
   - Path: `Computer Configuration â†’ Policies â†’ Windows Settings â†’ Security Settings â†’ Account Policies â†’ Password Policy`.
   - Settings applied:
     - Enforce password history = 5  
     - Maximum password age = 30 days  
     - Minimum password age = 1 day  
     - Minimum password length = 8  
     - Complexity requirements = Enabled  
   - **Why:** Enforces stronger password hygiene and prevents weak/reused passwords.

3. **Forced Policy Update**
   - On CLIENT01: ran `gpupdate /force`.  
   - Logged off and back on.  
   - **Why:** Ensured immediate application of updated domain password rules.

4. **Tested Password Changes**
   - Attempted to reuse an old password â†’ rejected.  
   - Attempted to use a simple password (e.g., "password") â†’ rejected.  
   - **Why:** Confirmed policy enforcement is active on domain accounts.

5. **Verified Policy**
   - Ran `gpresult /r` on CLIENT01.  
   - **Observation:** Password rules were enforced, but Default Domain Policy was not listed under applied GPOs.  
   - **Why:** Password policies are stored in the **Default Domain Policy GPO**, but they apply at the domain level through **secedit / local security policy**, so they donâ€™t always appear in `gpresult`. This is expected behavior.

## ðŸ§  Reflection
- Learned that **domain password policies must be set in the Default Domain Policy** for them to take effect.  
- Confirmed enforcement through practical testing on CLIENT01, even though `gpresult` did not explicitly list the policy.  
- Key takeaway: **Password policy is enforced at the domain level, not per-user GPO reporting.** This means the rules work even if they donâ€™t appear in gpresult output.  
- This is a real-world sysadmin skill: knowing where to configure password rules and how to test them is more important than what the reporting tools show.
