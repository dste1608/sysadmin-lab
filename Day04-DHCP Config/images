# Day 4 â€“ Configure DHCP and Test Client Assignment

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Install and configure DHCP on DC01 to automatically assign IPs and confirm DNS integration.

## ðŸ›  Steps Completed
1. Installed DHCP role on DC01 via Server Manager.  
   - **Why:** Provides automated IP addressing service.  
2. Authorized DHCP server in AD.  
   - **Why:** Prevents rogue DHCP servers on the domain.  
3. Created scope "LabScope" with IP range 10.10.10.100-10.10.10.200.  
   - **Why:** Defines pool of addresses clients can use.  
4. Configured gateway (10.10.10.1) and DNS (10.10.10.10).  
   - **Why:** Ensures clients can reach firewall + domain controller.  
5. Excluded reserved IPs (.1 for OPNsense, .10 for DC01).  
   - **Why:** Avoids conflicts with static servers.  
6. Activated the DHCP scope.  
   - **Why:** Scope must be active to serve leases.  
7. On CLIENT01, confirmed IP assignment via `ipconfig /all`.  
   - **Why:** Proves DHCP is functioning end-to-end.  
8. Verified CLIENT01 registered in DNS under lab.local.  
   - **Why:** Ensures domain name resolution works for AD clients.

## ðŸ§  Reflection
- DHCP automation saves time and reduces human error in IP management.  
- Integration with DNS is key for AD functionality.
