# Day 3 â€“ Configure and Verify DNS

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Configure and validate DNS on DC01 for the `lab.local` domain, ensuring both AD-integrated and external name resolution.

## ðŸ›  Steps Completed
1. Opened DNS Manager on DC01.  
   - **Why:** Central place for DNS zone/record management.  
2. Verified `lab.local` forward lookup zone exists and SRV records present.  
   - **Why:** AD requires SRV records to locate domain controllers.  
3. Created reverse lookup zone for `192.168.1.x`.  
   - **Why:** Enables IP â†’ hostname lookups, useful in troubleshooting/logs.  
4. Added A record: `fileserver.lab.local â†’ 192.168.1.50` with PTR.  
   - **Why:** Test record for forward/reverse resolution.  
5. Configured DNS Forwarders to `8.8.8.8`.  
   - **Why:** Allows internet resolution for lab clients.  
6. On CLIENT01, ran `nslookup` tests:  
   - `fileserver.lab.local â†’ 192.168.1.50`  
   - `192.168.1.50 â†’ fileserver.lab.local`  
   - `google.com â†’ external IPs`  
   - **Why:** Validates internal + external DNS resolution is working.

## ðŸ§  Reflection
- Learned DNS is the backbone of AD.  
- Misconfigured DNS = broken logins, policies, or domain joins.  
- Tomorrow: Configure DHCP and integrate it with AD DNS.
